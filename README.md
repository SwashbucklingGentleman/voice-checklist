# Voice Checklist
A single page web application for controlling a checklist with voice commands.

This vue.js app uses [aanyang!](https://github.com/TalAter/annyang) to recognize voice commands to manage items in a checklist.

The reason I created this was to enable me to have a checklist of things to do while
running through Dark Souls III without the need to use my hands. It could have
broader use for other games, or any kind of hands-free checklisting.
